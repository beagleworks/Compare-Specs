# Implementation Plan: Denpyo Web Application

**Branch**: `001-web-1-denpyo` | **Date**: 2025-09-05 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-web-1-denpyo/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
The project is to create a web application named "Denpyo" for creating and managing transfer slips. The backend will be implemented with Deno and Hono, the frontend with React and TypeScript, and storage will use SQLite. Development will follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript (via Deno 1.x, Node 18.x)
**Primary Dependencies**: Deno, Hono, React, Vite
**Storage**: SQLite
**Testing**: Deno built-in test runner, Vitest (following TDD)
**Target Platform**: Modern Web Browsers
**Project Type**: web
**Performance Goals**: Not specified for this scope.
**Constraints**: Must be a single-user application, password protected.
**Scale/Scope**: A simple CRUD application for personal use.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**: PASS
- Projects: 2 (backend, frontend)
- Using framework directly? Yes
- Single data model? Yes
- Avoiding patterns? Yes, no complex patterns needed.

**Architecture**: PASS
- EVERY feature as library? No, this is a single application, not a library-based system. The principle is not applicable here.
- Libraries listed: N/A
- CLI per library: N/A
- Library docs: N/A

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: PASS
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes, this is a core requirement of the plan.
- Git commits show tests before implementation? This will be followed.
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes.
- Real dependencies used? Yes, SQLite will be used in tests.
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? Yes.
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase. Yes.

**Observability**: N/A (Not specified in requirements)

**Versioning**: N/A (Not specified in requirements)

**Structure Decision**: Option 2: Web application

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
Completed. See `research.md` for details.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
Completed. See `data-model.md`, `contracts/api.md`, and `quickstart.md` for details.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
The `/tasks` command will generate a detailed `tasks.md` file by breaking down the implementation into small, actionable steps. It will use the artifacts from Phase 1 as input:
- **From `data-model.md`**: Create tasks for setting up the database schema and models.
- **From `contracts/api.md`**: Create tasks for writing failing contract tests for each endpoint, and then implementing the API endpoints to make them pass.
- **From `quickstart.md` and `spec.md`**: Create tasks for setting up the frontend project, building UI components, and writing integration tests based on user stories.

**Ordering Strategy**:
Tasks will be ordered following TDD and dependency principles: 
1.  Setup backend & frontend project structures.
2.  Write failing database tests, then create schema.
3.  Write failing API contract tests, then implement API endpoints.
4.  Write failing UI component tests, then build components.
5.  Write failing integration tests, then integrate frontend and backend.

**Estimated Output**: A `tasks.md` file with 20-30 ordered tasks.

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
No violations to document.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
